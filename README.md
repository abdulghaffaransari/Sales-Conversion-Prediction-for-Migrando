# Sales Conversion Prediction for Migrando

This project focuses on predicting sales conversion probabilities for Migrando's settlement permit and naturalization services using machine learning techniques. Migrando provides two products: settlement permit and naturalization, handling the implementation and bureaucratic efforts for the application post-purchase. The dataset comprises demographic information, past interactions, and outcomes.

## Overview

The project encompasses the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleanse and preprocess the dataset, addressing missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature engineering.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Investigate the dataset to glean insights into feature distributions, correlations, and potential patterns.
3. **Model Selection and Training:** Employ machine learning algorithms like RandomForest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine to forecast sales conversion probabilities.
4. **Evaluation:** Assess model performance utilizing appropriate metrics and techniques such as accuracy, correlation analysis, and visualization.
5. **Advanced Techniques:** Apply ensemble learning methods such as Stacking Classifiers to enhance prediction accuracy.
6. **Deployment:** Deploy the trained model to anticipate sales conversion probabilities for new data instances.
